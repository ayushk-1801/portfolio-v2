# Markdown Guide for Blog Posts

This guide will help you learn how to format your blog posts using Markdown syntax.

## Basic Text Formatting

Markdown makes it easy to format your text. Here are some basic examples:

- **Bold text** is created with `**double asterisks**`
- *Italic text* is created with `*single asterisks*`
- ***Bold and italic*** is created with `***three asterisks***`

## Headings

You can create headings using the hash symbol:

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
```

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Item 3

### Ordered Lists

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

## Code

You can include inline code with backticks: `const greeting = "Hello World";`

Or code blocks with triple backticks and language name:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("Reader"));
```
